# Dockerize Rails application

This repository is aimed at providing a docker based starter approach for setting up the development environment of rails application. 

The code related to docker (Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml) is complete and in place but this will require a lot of documentation to explain how things work. 

I have referred to docker hub pages of phpmyadmin, mysql and ruby as well docker-compose documentation to get things in place and working. 

Documentation coming soon. Hopefully :)
